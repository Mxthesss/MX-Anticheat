# MX-Anticheat

This Anticheat is not for the big servers but for the brand new to the scene who don’t have that much budget to spend $100 on a fully functional anticheat, but today I’m going to introduce you to my new anticheat. I won’t say here how this anticheat is revolutionary, etc., but what can I say and I dare say that it can detect various events that the average cheater could use now. :wink:

Webhooks:

Fully working webhook system.
